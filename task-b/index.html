<h1>Eero Sormunen</h1>
<p>I am a scary xenomorph from another planet. I hunt other organic life forms aboard their space-vessels. I lay eggs and my hatchlings are colloquially known as: "Face-huggers," due to their habit of latching onto their victims mouths.</p>
<ul>
    <li>I have acidic blood that can burn through metal.</li>
    <li>I have a long, barbed tongue that I use to impale my victims.</li>
    <li>I am incredibly strong and fast.</li>
    <li>I have a tough exoskeleton that protects me from harm.</li>
    <li>I am a master of stealth and can blend into my surroundings.</li>
    <li>I am a relentless hunter and will stop at nothing to achieve my goals.</li>
    <li>I am a terrifying creature that strikes fear into the hearts of all who encounter me.</li>
    <li>I am a symbol of the unknown and the dangers that lurk in the depths of space.</li>
    <li>I am a reminder of the fragility of human life and the importance of caution when exploring the unknown.</li>
</ul>
